        Instructions:<br>
        In this game you manage the research done by a nondescript civilization from the dawn of humankind to the near future.<br>

        This is a turn based game. For each turn you can buy as much technologies as you want by clicking on the upgrade cards, as long as you have enough gold (Or else the end turn button will be disabled). The purchases will take effect when you end your turn. This area will then display all the descriptions of the upgrades you just purchased.<br>

        Choose your upgrades wisely, as they will unlock different technologies in the future, providing different impacts on your resources.<br>

        Starting from the 3rd turn, you will start to encounter random events that will affect your resources. These events are real world demonstration on what obstacles or benefits one may encounter that affects science advancements.<br>

        On your top right is your resource bar. Gold is what you will use to purchase the upgrades, happiness is a general expression on how your society feels about your investments as you progress through the game. Science effects the chances of random events, precisely you will have a higher chance encountering good events with higher science.<br>

        Your objective is to get as much happiness as possible for your civilization. Enjoy!
